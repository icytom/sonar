# Sonar

A simple sonar system made in p5.js

May eventually turn into a submarine hunting game

Clicks on the canvas generate a pulse of particles which move out from the location of the mouse click, when they detect white pixels on a collition map image they stop.

Over time the particles fade out

If a click is regestered on a white pixel from the image map no particles are generated

Image map is currently set to the UK
